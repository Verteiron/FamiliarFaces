{"name":"Familiar Faces","tagline":"A Skyrim mod that allows characters to be shared between different playthroughs","body":"## Release 0.45 is out! Download it [here](vMYC_FamiliarFaces045.7z)!\r\n* **Clean install is HIGHLY recommended for this version!**\r\n* Shrine of Heroes can now be managed from MCM panel\r\n* Characters now report readiness to the Shrine faster, which speeds up load time\r\n* Minor backend changes\r\n\r\n### Updates in preview version (0.44)\r\n* Perks are now FULLY IMPLEMENTED!\r\n* Custom locations: If you use the Portal Stone in a named location, that location will become available as a \"Hangout\" for your character in MCM.\r\n* Next milestone will be v.45-testrelease5, currently scheduled for release on Thursday, June 19th.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis is a development version of Familiar Faces. There are bugs, possibly severe ones. You should be comfortable installing Skyrim mods and have a basic grasp of things like directory structures, 7z files, and load order.\r\n\r\nThis is a closed test. No NDAs to sign, but I ask that you do not redistribute these files, post public YouTube videos of it in action, etc.\r\n\r\n*BACK UP YOUR SAVED GAMES, YOUR DATA DIRECTORY, YOUR MOD LIST, LOAD ORDER, INI FILES, EVERYTHING BEFORE INSTALLING THIS!* I will not help you pick up the pieces if it destroys your carefully laid-out load order or indeed fries your entire computer because you didn't make a back-up first.\r\n\r\n## Reporting a bug\r\nPlease check the list of Quirks and Known Bugs below before reporting!\r\n\r\n###If the game crashed:\r\n* Make a copy of the Papyrus log and all contents of Data/vMYC before you relaunch the game.\r\n* Send those files to me, along with any problems you noticed before the crash and what you did leading up to it.\r\n* If you can consistently reproduce the crash, be sure to tell me how.\r\n\r\n###If not:\r\n\r\n* Take screenshots if they will help demonstrate the bug in question.\r\n* Make a copy of the same files as listed above AS SOON AS YOU EXIT THE GAME. It's important that you make a copy of the files before you start playing again, as they will get changed the next time you start the game up.\r\n* Send me the copied files and a report of what the bug was, what you were doing when it happened, and a brief outline of the steps that brought you to that point.\r\n* If you can reliably reproduce it, tell me how.\r\n\r\nSend bug reports to: verteiron+ffbugs@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Latest version of Skyrim - Dawnguard and Dragonborn are supported but not required.\r\n* SKSE 1.7.0 - Not included. Download and install if you're not using it already. Earlier versions WILL NOT WORK. The mod will notice if SKSE is missing and will shut down.\r\n* SkyUI 4.1 - Not included. Required for using MCM.\r\n* JContainers 0.67 or higher - Included. This is an SKSE plugin that is packaged with this testing edition.\r\n* CharGen.dll - Included. This is a special testing version of Expired's CharGen Extender SKSE plugin. See the Warnings section below. If you are running the release versions of CharGen Extender or RaceMenu, BACK THEM UP BEFORE INSTALLING FAMILIAR FACES.\r\n* [Extensible Follower Framework](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12933/?) - Not required, but recommended for follower management. UFO and AFT should also work, but EFF is specifically supported.\r\n* [Auto Unequip Ammo](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10753/?) - Not required, but recommended to help your imported followers (who frequently have several types of ammo on them) pick the best ammo for their current weapon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Dawnguard and Dragonborn are supported but not required.\r\n* Enhanced Character Edit (ECE) is **NOT** compatible with Familiar Faces and likely won't be any time in the near future. This is not due to any particular flaw in ECE, it just uses a different system than CharGen Extender, which is what I'm relying on.\r\n* Body replacer mods such CBBE should be compatible. Face replacer mods should work (provided they don't rely on ECE), but exported characters will probably not load properly if the face-altering mod is removed.\r\n* Mods that add NIOverride overlays (body tattoos, scars, glowing face tattoos, etc) to RaceMenu ~~will be supported, but don't work yet~~ are now fully supported (and in need of testing!)\r\n* Some ENB setups may interfere with ImageSpaceOverrides, meaning some animations that normally fade to white to hide animation glitches will not do so. Please let me know if you're using ENB before reporting animation bugs.\r\n\r\n##Testing setup\r\n\r\nIf your current mod setup is stable, feel free to use it with Familiar Faces. Please make sure it is stable, though. If you find a bug, I may ask you to try to reproduce without certain mods loaded, so be sure you know how to enable/disable mods on your load list.\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug, it will be really helpful to have a Papyrus log to send me so I can try to figure out what happened. Make sure the following settings are present in your Skyrim.ini:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[Papyrus]\r\nbEnableLogging=1 \r\nbEnableTrace=1 \r\nbLoadDebugInformation=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Papyrus log will be located in your Documents folders under _My Games/Skyrim/Logs/Script/_ and will be named _Papyrus.0.log_.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nYou can use NMM or MO to install the mod from the 7z file. Other managers such as Wrye have not been tested, but should work. You can install manually simply by extracting the 7z file to the Skyrim/Data directory.\r\n\r\n###Mod Organizer note\r\n\r\nFamiliar Faces does work with Mod Organizer, but files that get created during gameplay will be written to the OverWrite directory instead of to FF's mod tree. This is normal, but it does make MO show a warning. These files can be safely moved into the Familiar Faces tree after you exit Skyrim. Also note that if you need to send me the contents of Data/vMYC, you'll have to pull them from MO's Mod or Override directory instead of your Skyrim installation folder.\r\n\r\n##Uninstallation\r\n\r\nMake sure all followers provided by Familiar Faces are dismissed from your service before removing the mod.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to reinstall the mod, leave the Data/vMYC directory intact or at least back it up. It contains all the saved character data. Otherwise...\r\n\r\nIf you used NMM to install, uninstallation will work but may leave files behind in Data/vYMC. If you used MO, files may remain in your Override directory in the same location.\r\n\r\nSearch for and remove ALL files and folders in Skyrim/Data that begin with \"vMYC\". Remove JContainers.dll and the included version of CharGen.dll if you aren't using them for any other mods.\r\n\r\n##Getting started\r\n\r\nShortly after starting or loading a game, you should receive a Portal Stone in your inventory. You can use that stone from your Inventory (under misc items) to warp to the Shrine of Heroes. Activate the \"Tome of the Dragonborn\" in front of an empty shrine to save your character there. The save process will take some time, dependent on how many skills, perks, and inventory items your character has.\r\n\r\nNow load up a different game, use the Portal Stone (there may be a delay before it gets placed in your inventory, just wait), and you can open the Tome of your saved character to send them into the world. They will have a default spawn point which can be changed from within MCM. Upon talking to them, you should be able to recruit them as followers.\r\n\r\nAfter that, just play around with your imported character as a follower!\r\n\r\n##What to test first (aka the sanity check)\r\n\r\nThis early release basically serves to make sure the core functionality is working across multiple computer and mod setups (within reason). Please check for all of the following and report if ANY of them aren't working properly:\r\n\r\n* The Portal Stone is placed in your inventory shortly after starting or loading a game. This may take a minute, see Quirks.\r\n* The Portal Stone warps you into the Shrine, and the central portal of the Shrine warps you back to where you used the stone. An animation should play in both instances.\r\n* The books allow you to save your character.\r\n* The save animation is relatively smooth and does not take longer than about 60 seconds.\r\n* After saving, various trophies should appear in the shrine based on what side-quests you have completed. Most of these should be obvious. A complete list is given below.\r\n* Character statues should be an exact duplicate of the player. Face tattoos, dirt, scars, eye color, hair style and color (including mod-provided styles and custom colors from RaceMenu), and skin tones should match exactly. The Shrine statues are oversized on purpose, but when brought into the world the character should be the correct height.\r\n* If you have customized/named armor and weapons equipped, they should be duplicated exactly as well, with tempering and any custom enchantments intact. This can be checked by recruiting the character and opening the trade menu. Or make them non-essential, kill them, and loot them. You monster. Equipped armor and weapons provided by installed mods should also be duplicated.\r\n* The character should have all the same ammo and most of the same spells as the player.\r\n* Upon entering the Shrine from another saved game, all saved characters should look correct and be loaded in the same alcove they were saved in.\r\n* Characters can be summoned into the world via the book from other saves. The book should open and the character should vanish from the Shrine.\r\n* You should get a quest called Familiar Faces, with a marker pointing to your character's location. This marker should vanish once they have been recruited.\r\n* Characters can be recruited as Followers once located in the world. If the recruiting dialog doesn't appear, see the Known Problems section before reporting a bug.\r\n* Characters can be \"banished\" back to the shrine by closing their book again. This should remove them from the world and place them back in their Shrine in a mannequin pose.\r\n* SkyUI's MCM can be used to control the character's class (how their points get distributed based on the player's level), spawn point, and voicetype. You can also use the MCM to warp to the character's location to speed things up.\r\n\r\nIf the mod does all of the above, everything is working as it should! Please let me know if this is the case, and continue to play with the mod to find bugs or issues!\r\n\r\n##Quirks\r\n\r\nThe following are not bugs and should not be reported:\r\n\r\n* The game will hiccup or hang for a moment when entering the Shrine. This is a side effect of loading the CharGen data and can't be avoided. It should only occur when the character models are loading or when changing a character's Class via MCM.\r\n* Saved characters will quickly vanish and reappear after you load your game. Prior to disappearing they will either be headless or have distorted faces. This is normal.\r\n* Characters will vanish for a second when their Class is changed via MCM. This is normal.\r\n* Some characters in the shrines may be in mannequin poses, others may not. This is due to how Skyrim handles loading models and can't be avoided easily.\r\n* The Portal Stone may take nearly a minute to appear in your inventory. This is normal and will vary based on how many characters you have saved in the Shrine.\r\n* The General Options panel of the mod's MCM is empty.\r\n* This test release contains a development copy of Expired's CharGen.dll SKSE plugin. It is distributed with his permission, but with the following warning:\r\n> \"dont go to the Morphs category if you use RaceMenu. bad shit will happen.\" - Expired.\r\nIf you must poke around in Morphs (seriously, it doesn't work yet, don't mess with it), then quit Skyrim completely and restart it before continuing to test Familiar Faces.\r\n* If your character is a Vampire/Vampire Lord, they may suffer from the gray-face bug. This is an issue with Dawnguard vampires and probably can't be fixed without making the mod dependent on Dawnguard.esm. If need be I'll distribute two versions of the mod to address this problem.\r\n\r\n##Known bugs\r\n\r\nThe following are bugs but don't need to be reported unless they're dramatically worse or different on your system:\r\n\r\n* If you have more than 5 characters without ANY side-quest achievements, they may not get sent to the world when their book is opened, or may end up in a random place.\r\n* The imported character may not give you the recruitment dialog. This is due to not every default voicetype having Follower options. If this happens, use MCM to change that character's voicetype to one of those listed as a Follower here. Alternatively, installing this mod may help.\r\n* Characters will ignore their weapons and use Magic, regardless of their Class. Try selecting them and typing ForceAV Magicka 0 in the console to force them to use their weapon. This is a complex problem that I'm working on.\r\n* If you have several shrines next to each other, especially with lots of trophies, you may find the lighting doesn't work properly during the save animation. I've taken some steps to mitigate this but it is fundamentally an engine limitation I wasn't aware of before building the shrine. A fairly radical redesign may be needed to fix this and that probably won't happen before the initial release.\r\n\r\n#Thanks!\r\n\r\nThank you for helping me make Familiar Faces the best mod it can be. All early testers will be credited in the mod's description on Skyrim Nexus; it's not much of a thank you, but it's all I've got!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
